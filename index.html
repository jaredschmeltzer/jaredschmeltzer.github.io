   	<h3>The effects of war on our soldiers:</h3>
	<p>Many people do not realize that war has very bad affects on the soldiers who are on the front line to protect us. After being deployed and returning back home from a military deployment, many of these soldiers suffer from severe PTSD ( Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ). PTSD is a  phyciatric disorder that is caused by events that have happened to the person ( in this case, war ). Because of PTSD, these soldiers have trouble sleeping, they can be on edge at times and they may also react in a certain way to loud sounds.

  <h3>Sacrifices made by soldiers:</h3>
  <p>Our soldiers make make many sacrifices aside from serving our country and protecting us. There are many videos and/or articles about soldier who go above and beyond their line of duty to ensure that others feel happy or safe. As an example, in this video you will see that this soldier wasnt even on duty at the time but he took it upon himself to help the kids out and buy them food; from his own pocket. This is truly amazing, he wasnt on duty and he still felt the need and had the goodness in his heart to help the kids ( see linked video ).</p>
